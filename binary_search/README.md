#Leetcode上的BinarySearch的33题,Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
> (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
- You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

- You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
- 以一个数字为pivot，旋转
- 一定用binary search来做
